Intelligent Job Application Tracker & Skill Gap Analyzer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Real world problem:

Job seekers apply to dozens of companies but struggle with:

• Tracking application status (Applied, Interview, Rejected, Offer)

• Remembering follow-ups

• Understanding which skills they are missing for the roles they apply to

• Improving their profile strategically instead of randomly learning skills

This project solves organization + decision-making using Python logic

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q) Question to solve?

-> Can I build a system that tracks job applications, analyzes required skills across roles, 
compares them with the user’s skills, and recommends what to learn next to maximize 
interview chances?
